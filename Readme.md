## Tailwind CSS, creating custom theme and testing tailwind latest versions
This folder is all about the testing tailwind CSS and its latest updates. We can extend or create our custom theme using tailwind.config.js file and extend options. Make sure you always use extend option so that you don't override any builtin tailwind classes. 
`do not forget to run your tailwind in watch mode everytime you restart your coding.`    
command for running the tailwind css in watch mode is     
```
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```
### Container class
We find dynamic screen size adjustment as per container class. 
### max-width and mx-auto 
These classes are best utilized for dealing with width. 
### Grid for page layout
Use grid for layout of the page and alternatively you can use flex as well.
