## Tailwind CSS, creating custom theme and testing tailwind latest versions
This folder is all about the testing tailwind CSS and its latest updates. We can extend or create our custom theme using tailwind.config.js file and extend options. Make sure you always use extend option so that you don't override any builtin tailwind classes. 
### Container class
We find dynamic screen size adjustment as per container class.
